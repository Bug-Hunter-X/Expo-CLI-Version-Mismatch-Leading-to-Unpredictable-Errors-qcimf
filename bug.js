This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the dependencies specified in your project's `package.json` file.  It can manifest in different ways, sometimes subtly, making it hard to pinpoint. For example, you might get seemingly unrelated errors during build or start, or the app might crash unexpectedly on the device or simulator.  One particular case is when upgrading Expo Go, you may face unexpected issues if the Go version doesn't align perfectly with your project's configuration.
