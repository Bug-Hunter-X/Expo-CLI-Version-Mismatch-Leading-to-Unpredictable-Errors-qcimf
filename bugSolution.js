The solution involves a multi-step process:

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI installed using `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.
2. **Check `package.json`:** Examine your project's `package.json` file for Expo-related dependencies.  Make sure the versions are compatible with your updated CLI.  You might need to update `expo` and associated packages.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** After updating, try clearing the cache with `expo prebuild --clean` and then rebuild your project (`expo start`).
4. **Expo SDK Version:** Pay close attention to the Expo SDK version mentioned in your `package.json` and in the Expo CLI documentation to ensure that they are compatible.  An outdated SDK can often cause conflicts with the newer CLI.
5. **Upgrade Expo Go:**  If using Expo Go, ensure that you have the latest version installed. An out-of-date Expo Go app may not support the features or versions of your project.

Example using npm (adapt for yarn if needed):
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
npm install expo@latest --save
```
Following these steps should resolve most version mismatch issues. If problems persist, carefully review Expo's documentation for the specific versions used in your project.
